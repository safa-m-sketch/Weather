# Weather
This program uses real-time data from the OpenWeatherMap API

Through this project, I was able to:
- Get familiar with using APIs
- Implement images
- 
I first started with just basic outputting in the console to get familiar with how APIs worked, and from there, created a GUI

Through this project, you can get access to the temperature of any city worldwide!
- Current temp
- Feels like temp
- High temp
- Low temp
