# Weather
Data from OpenWeatherMap API

Through this project I was able to get familar with using APIs
I first started out with just basic outputting in the console to get familiar with how APIs worked and from there created a GUI

Through this project you can get access to the temperature of any city worldwide!
- Current temp
- Feels like temp
- High temp
- Low temp
Along with corresponding image presenting the current weather
